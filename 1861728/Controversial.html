<h1>The debate of the century: Which is better, Coca Cola, or Pepsi? Just kidding, that's been done to death. <br>This website looks at the differences in 7up and Sprite, and aims to explain how 7up is clearly superior to Sprite!</h1>  <br>

    <font size="+2">Yes, the focus of this website is to show the statistics comparing things like sodium, flavor, calorie content, date of arrival, flavors & variety, corruption in the product monufacturers, quality of product, ad campaigns; the usual suspects. The combination of this data should prove that 7up is amazing and Sprite is just evil sugar-water made by Satan designed to slowly kill you and your dog.<br><br><br></font>

    <font size="+2">And just so you know, this website will be mostly 7up-themed because  7up is my gospel, as it should be yours, praised be 7up!</font><br><br><br><br>
